# Auto-Merge System Demo

This file demonstrates the complete auto-merge system with **Hermes + Zeus** governance.

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is opened, the following should happen automatically:

### 1. **Hermes (The Scribe)** Actions:
- ✅ **PR Size Labeler**: Labels this PR as `size:XS` (very small change)
- ✅ **Auto-Mark Trivial**: Detects this is docs-only and marks as `trivial`
- ✅ **Safe-to-Merge**: Automatically adds `safe-to-merge` label
- ✅ **Comments**: Explains why labels were applied

### 2. **Zeus (The Arbiter)** Actions:
- ✅ **Auto-Merge**: Enables GitHub's native auto-merge for `safe-to-merge` PRs
- ✅ **Guardrails**: Ensures PR is not draft and reviews are satisfied
- ✅ **Fail-Safe**: Will remove labels if any checks fail

### 3. **Complete Flow**:
1. PR opened → Hermes analyzes and labels
2. Labels applied → Zeus enables auto-merge
3. All checks pass → GitHub automatically merges
4. If checks fail → Zeus removes labels until fixed

## Test Results

This PR should be **fully self-driving**:
- No manual intervention required
- Transparent with explanatory comments
- Safe with multiple guardrails
- Democratic with civic governance
