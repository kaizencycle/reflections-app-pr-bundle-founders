## 🏛 What is this?

This is the **public-facing Reflections App**, the **digital town hall** of the Cathedral OS.  
Citizens, Companions, and Elders onboard here into the HIVE game world.

- **Hermes** ✍️ tracks proposals and logs civic history  
- **Zeus** ⚡ enforces encoded rules and ensures fair merges  

## ⚖️ How it works

- Every **PR = proposal**  
- Checks = **deliberation**  
- Merge = **motion passed**  

### 🚦 Rules
- Add `auto-merge` to enable automatic merging (once checks pass)  
- Trivial + size:XS PRs may be auto-labeled `safe-to-merge`  
- If checks fail, Zeus removes merge labels and comments  

## 🎮 Game Integration

This repo IS the game's operating system:
- **Quest completions** → PRs to ledger
- **Shard discoveries** → commits to history
- **Citizen reflections** → governance proposals  
- **XP/GIC earned** → stake in civic decisions

### 🕹️ For Players
- Complete quests in the 16-bit HIVE world
- Earn XP that converts to GIC (governance stake)
- Participate in civic decisions through the game interface
- Watch your actions become permanent history in this repo

### 🎨 For Artists & Developers
- This repo's UI elements (badges, labels, merge flows) mirror the game's HUD
- PR size labels (`XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`) = quest difficulty levels
- Auto-merge animations = quest completion celebrations
- Governance votes = in-game civic participation

## 🪞 Why it matters

This repo demonstrates **AI-native governance**:
- Transparent rules encoded in workflows
- Tamper-evident decisions logged in git history  
- Shared ownership of digital civilization
- No corporation or single maintainer controls outcomes

**Welcome to the Cathedral Town Hall** 🕊️
