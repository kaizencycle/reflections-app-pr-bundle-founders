# Smoke Test - Complete AI Automation System

This file was created to test the complete civic-governed AI automation ecosystem.

## Expected Automation Behavior

When this PR is created, the following should happen automatically:

### 1. PR Size Labeler
- Should apply a size label (likely `size:XS` for this small change)
- Should post a stats comment with PR metrics table
- Should use synchronized thresholds from Actions Variables

### 2. Auto-Label System  
- May apply `bot-suggest` label if PR is small enough and touches safe paths
- Should respect the `ALLOWED_LABELERS` access control
- Should add explanatory comment if auto-labeled

### 3. AI Review Workflows
- GitHub Models workflow should analyze the diff and comment
- OpenAI fallback should work if GitHub Models unavailable
- Both should provide code review feedback

### 4. Label Guard
- Should prevent unauthorized users from manually adding `bot-suggest`
- Should remove unauthorized labels with polite explanation

### 5. Civic Governance Integration
- All workflows should respect constitutional constraints
- Bot operations subject to same democratic rules as humans
- Emergency freeze capabilities should work if needed

## Test Metrics

- **File**: Single new documentation file
- **Size**: Small (< 50 lines)
- **Path**: `docs/**` (safe path for automation)
- **Type**: Documentation (low risk)

## Success Criteria

✅ Size label applied automatically  
✅ Stats comment appears with metrics  
✅ AI review comments posted  
✅ No workflow errors in Actions  
✅ All thresholds synchronized  

This test validates that the complete system is working as designed with proper safety constraints and democratic governance.
