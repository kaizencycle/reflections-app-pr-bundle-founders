<!-- What changed and why? Keep public details neutral. -->

## Scope
- [ ] Public API / README

## Checks
- [ ] I ran `scripts/redaction-scan.sh` locally (no forbidden terms)
- [ ] No private keys, tokens, or credentials included
- [ ] If touching /docs or /app/core, I understand PR requires @kaizencycle review
